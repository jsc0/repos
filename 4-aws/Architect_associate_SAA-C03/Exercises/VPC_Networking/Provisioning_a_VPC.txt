We built a custom VPC in us-east-1 for network: 10.0.0.0/16
As soon as we created the VPC it automatically created:
	A Route Table
	A Network ACL
	A Security Group
We created the subnets (10.0.1.0/24, 10.0.2.0/24) adding them to the new VPC.
We enable auto-assign public IP for 10.0.1.0/24 
We then created the Internet Gateway and attached it to the new VPC.
We created another Route Tables pointing to 0.0.0.0/0 and to the Internet Gateway and has been associated to the public network 10.0.1.0/24.
We added another Security Group, WebDMZ, with incoming 0.0.0.0/0 to http.
We deployed a Webserver (adding it in the public subnet), checking that we can see the hello world website created on it via browser using the public IP
We deployed a Database server (adding it in the private subnet), creating a new security group allowing ssh from WebDMZ security group (the webserver)
From the webserver weâ€™ve sshed to the database server successfully after copying our private key in the webserver.
We can see that the database server cannot be updated because has no access to internet.
Create a NAT Gateway.
