Steps to create an Auto Scaling Group (In order of aparence): 
What do you need to create an ASG.

* Launch Template
* Network (VPC, AZs). Better to do it here in ASG than in the Launch Template.
* Load Balancer: Yes/No/Create it
* Size: Max/Min/Desirable
	- Automatic Scaling (Optional)
		• No Scaling Policies
		• Target Tracking scaling policy (after creating ASG, you can select
		the other Scaling policies,Predictive and Schedule).
* SNS (optional)
* Done.

----- Auto Scaling Policies: ----- 
* Dynamic scaling policies:
	- Target Tracking scaling policy: You set one metric, like CPU 50%, and it will scale up 					  or down as much as necessary to achieve it.
		• Metric: CPU / Network In or Out / Load Balancer.

	- Simple Scaling: One metric that triggers one action, just one single metric/action.
		• Metrics: CloudWatch Alarm.

	- Step Scaling: Exactly the same than Simple scaling, one metric / one action but 
			you can add more metric/action as you want.
		• Metrics: CloudWatch Alarm.

* Predictive Scaling Policies: Using machine learning, the instances are scaled 
on a forecast based in the past.
	- Metrics: CPU, Network In or Out, Load Balancer and custom metrics.
	
* Scheduled actions: You schedule when to scale out or in.
