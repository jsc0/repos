Components of IAM:------------------------------------------------

-- Users:

-- Groups --> Many users together form a group. Collection of IAM users.
You can use IAM groups to specify permissions for multiple users.
Any permission applied to the group are applied to the users inside 
this group.

A new person joins the company. You can add him to the proper group and 
he will have that group permissions automatically.

-- Roles --> Temporary credentials 

-- Policies --> Json object in AWS that, when associated with an identity or
resource, defines their permissions.

You manage access to AWS by creating policies and attaching them to AIM 
identities (users,groups,roles or aws resources)
