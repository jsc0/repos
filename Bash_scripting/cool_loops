Cool Loops and tests:

--Send My program to output.txt every 3 seconds in an infinite loop and do it in the 
background. Good to see background jobs 

(while true;do echo -n "My program ">> ~/output.txt; sleep 3; done) &

-- Do the same but to test the cpu:
(while true;do echo -n "My program "> ~/output.txt; done) &

It will force the cpu. Run it several time to speed up the cpu utilization.
When you are done kill the jobs:  kill %1; kill %2 etc.

-- Take all the files that start with KARAF and append an empty space removing 
everything whas in the file.

for i in KARAF*; do echo "" > $i; done

--Create a heavy folder, 1GB. You can see how much time spends in being compressed:
dd if=/dev/zero of=/root/test.file bs=1M count=1024
