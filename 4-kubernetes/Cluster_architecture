Parts of the cluster:

##########################################################
Master Nodes:

##########################################################
Kube-apiserver:  
Primary management component on K8s.Responsible for orchestrating all operations within
the cluster.

It exposes the k8s API which is used by external users to perform management operations on the 
cluster, as well as the various controllers to monitor the state of the cluster and make 
necesary changes as required and by the worker nodes to communicate the server.

When you run kubectl you are reaching kube-apiserver, which authenticates the request and
validates it.It then retreives the data from etcd and responses back with the information.

You can interact with it using POST API requests.

#############################
ETCD: Service --> port 2379
Database that stores information in a key value format.Distributed, reliable, simple,secure
and fast. Uses etcdctl command line.

It stores information about Nodes, Pods, Configs, Secrets, Accounts, Roles, Bindings, others.

Can be set up manually, wget https://...etcd.tar.gz. Then you have to configure etcd.service
Or it's installed automatically by kubeadm when deploying the cluster, then etcd is a static
pod.

kubectl exec etcd-master -n kube-system -- sh -c "ETCDCTL_API=3 etcdctl get / --prefix --keys-only --limit=10 --cacert /etc/kubernetes/pki/etcd/ca.crt --cert /etc/kubernetes/pki/etcd/server.crt  --key /etc/kubernetes/pki/etcd/server.key" 


#############################
kube-scheduler: 

Identifies the right node to place the container on based on the container resource requirements, the workernode capacity or any other policies or constrains (taint, tolerations,node affinity rules, etc)

Is only responsible for deciding which POD goes on which Node.Kubelet then places the POD
on the Node.

#############################
Controller-Manager: Is a Daemon

Process that continuously monitores the state of various components within the system
and works towards bringing the whole system to the desired functioning state.

Controllers that takes care of different areas. Continues looks out for the status of the
cluster and remediate the situation when is necessary.

The Node-Controller takes cares of nodes, they are responsible for onboarding new nodes
to the cluster, handling situations where nodes become unavailable or gets destroyed.
 
The Replicatio-Controller ensures that the desired number of containers are running at all
times in a replication group.  

There are many more, like namespace-controller, serviceaccounts controller, enpoint controller, etc.


#############################
CRI: Container Runtime interface in all the nodes.
We have to install a CRI in all the nodes (master and workers) to run containers.
ContainerD, rkt, Docker.


##########################################################
Worker Nodes:

##########################################################
kubelet: Service. Is the capitan in each ship.

Agent that runs on each node in a cluster. It listens for instructions from the 
kube-apiserver and deploys or destroys containers on the nodes as required.

Kube-apiserver periodically fetches status reports from the kubelet to monitor the 
status of nodes and containers on them.

Load balances traffic between application components.
      
Handles networking communications between nodes. Routes traffic. Writes firewall rules to the routing tables of each nodes to allow the traffic to be routed properly.

You must always manually install the kubelet on the nodes nodes.

ps -aux |grep kubelet

#############################
Kube-proxy: Service

Ensures that necesary rules are in place on the worker nodes to allow the containers 
running on them to reach each other.

Helps in enabling communications between services within the cluster.

Process that run in each note in the k8s cluster. It's job is to look for new services and everytime a new service
is created it creates the appropiate rules on each node to forward traffic to those services to the backend pods.
One way to do this is by using iptables rules to forward traffic from one side to the other.
