IO ports are used to transfer data between the CPU and devices.

LVM
PEs are just a unit of allocation. Study PE
The PVs are carved up into PEs.

BIOS
the BIOS is used to load the first stage of the boot manager
/boot contains the kernel and later stages
the partition table is just a table pointing at the locations of the various partitions
MBR is the first place the BIOS looks for a bootable block.
MBR is the first block on the disk where the first stage of the bootloader and the partition tables are located.
