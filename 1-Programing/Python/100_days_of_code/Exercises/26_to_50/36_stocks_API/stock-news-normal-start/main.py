# This program get's the stock price of tesla, filters the last two closing prices, so yesterday and two days ago closing price
# Then compares both prices and gets the difference and gives you the % that have changed, example: 
# closing price 2 days ago =  100, closing price yesterday = 90, difference 10, the price have decreased 10%
# If the price goes up or down 5% you will receive an sms informing about this and will give you 
# the 3 first news of the company that may explain the price raise/down.
